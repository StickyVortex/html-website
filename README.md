<p>This is a website mainly for practicing my HTML and CSS, I am just starting to learn and don't know shit about it. In order to stay interested in this I will be making this page about content I find interesting starting with condemned, abandoned, or otherwise typically off limits areas and structures. Over time you can expect to find content here from many different areas of interest such as art, skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing, computer shit, and maybe even some social commentary. Although I won't be the commentator, I won't subject you to that.
